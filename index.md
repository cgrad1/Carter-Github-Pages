## Things I'm proud of

### 20Time

I'm the proudest of the work I've done on my 20Time project. A team effort put towards a game that we all have our specific parts in is something that I'm interested in working towards. My favourite part was the animating and making the maps. Of course, the story elements were also fun, but I'm no good as a writer.

## Things I plan to work towards

More game-oriented programming. Like classes, objects and animation with code.
